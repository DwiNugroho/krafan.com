Hey there! üëã I'm [Dwi Nugroho](https://github.com/DwiNugroho), I build this digital sanctuary known as [krafan.com](https://krafan.com). Buckle up, as I take you on a journey through my creative portfolio and digital garden.

## What's the Buzz about krafan.com?

[Krafan.com](https://krafan.com) is not just run-of-the-mill website; it's a Next.js 14-powered with the App Router steering the ship. üö¢ I build this website using MDX + Contentlayer, where my musings come to life alongside a dazzling array of projects showcased in a sleek portfolio format. Oh, and did I mention the magic touch of Tailwind CSS for styling? Yep, it's as stylish as it gets!

## Project Highlights:

- **Responsive Design**: Whether you're on a massive monitor or a pocket-sized device, Krafan.com looks sharp and snazzy.
- **Dark Mode**: Because creativity doesn't sleep, and neither should on this website. Toggle to the dark side for an immersive experience.
- **SEO Optimized**: Meta tags and JSON-LD are on point, ensuring [Krafan.com](https://krafan.com) shines bright on search engine landscapes.
- **RSS Feed & Sitemap**: Stay updated with the latest blog posts through the RSS feed, and let search engines explore the nooks and crannies with a well-structured sitemap.
