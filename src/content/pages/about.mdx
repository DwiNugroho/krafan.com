Passionate frontend engineer crafting awesome digital experiences.

Started my professional journey in 2019, exploring technologies like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [ViteJs](https://vitejs.dev/), dancing gracefully with frontend frameworks such as [ReactJs](https://react.dev/), [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/), [GatsbyJs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) for web development. and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) for mobile applications development.

Crafted my first web masterpiece at 15 using the classic tool, [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/). By 17, I was saying "hello world" with [C++](https://www.cplusplus.com/info/description/), setting the stage for my ongoing love affair with programming and computer science. My passion lies in creating unparalleled user experiences, and that's why I thrive as a frontend engineer.

### Hobbies

Beyond the lines of code, I find joy in the rhythm of music, particularly the thunderous beats of rock and metal. Bands like [ONE OK ROCK](https://www.youtube.com/user/ONEOKROCKchannel), [Queen](https://www.youtube.com/user/queenofficial), [Dream Theater](https://www.youtube.com/user/dreamtheater), [Sleeping with Sirens](https://www.youtube.com/user/SleepingWithSirens), and [Bring Me The Horizon](https://www.youtube.com/user/BMTHchannel) resonate with me. Drumming is my solace; I've been self-taught since the age of 13, and to this day, I find serenity in the rhythm of the drums.
