This thing makes whipping up Open Graph images a piece of cake. Just toss in your title, description, drop the link to your image, and bam! You got yourself a slick Open Graph image. I built this baby using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and worked some magic with the [@vercel/og](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions/og-image-generation) library to make it happen.

### Demo Time

### How to Use

1. Hop on over to [og.krafan.com](https://og.krafan.com).
2. Throw in your title and a snazzy description for that Open Graph vibe.
3. Toss in the link to the image you want to show off.
4. Smash that "Generate" button to work our magic.
5. Right-click the resulting image and hit "Save image as" to snag your Open Graph masterpiece (Or you can just grab the link from the bottom of the picture.).
