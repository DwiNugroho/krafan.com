## Why Did I Decide to Create a Personal Website?

Now, let's talk about this personal website thing. Why did I bother creating a website instead of just hanging out on Facebook or tweeting my life away? And seriously, why does a soy sauce bottle have a cap?

Well, it all started when I was casually surfing the internet and stumbled upon a website called [www.taniarascia.com](https://www.taniarascia.com/). This person had a website and was constantly dishing out tutorials on programming – talk about having too much free time! The next day, I decided to jump on the bandwagon and create my own personal website.

Apart from having a not-so-crazy schedule, the real reason behind this website is to document whatever I'm learning, showcase all the projects I've ever worked on, and, of course, brag about being able to build my own website.

Alright, enough chit-chat. I've got Dota waiting for me! Gotta go!
