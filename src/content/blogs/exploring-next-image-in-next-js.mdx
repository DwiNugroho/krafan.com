Recently, I unleashed my personal website – [krafan.com](/), showcasing my musings and an assortment of projects in the form of a portfolio. Imagine my surprise when I decided to put my website through the paces using the nifty tool at [pagespeed](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) and found my website performance score at 82.

<div className='relative mx-auto aspect-[5/2] w-full md:w-[80%]'>
  <Image
    src='/img/blogs/exploring-next-image-in-next-js/screenshot-1.png'
    className='!mt-0'
    sizes='100%'
    alt='pagespeed score'
    fill
  />
</div>

Digging into the diagnostics provided by [pagespeed](https://pagespeed.web.dev/), the main culprit unveiled itself – the images on my website were larger than necessary.

<div className='relative mx-auto aspect-[5/2] w-full md:w-[80%]'>
  <Image
    src='/img/blogs/exploring-next-image-in-next-js/screenshot-2.png'
    className='!mt-0'
    sizes='100%'
    alt='diagnostic'
    fill
  />
</div>

Picture this: a user visiting your site on their mobile device expecting an image of 400px × 200px, and you hit them with a whopping 2000px × 1000px image. That's a colossal 5x larger than what your users really need. So, let's dive into the realm of supercharging image optimization on your [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) website using the incredible power of [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image).

## Unleashing the Power of next/image!

So, what's the buzz about [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image), and why should you care? Well, [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image) is a built-in component in Next.js, making its grand entrance with the release of Next.js version 10.0.0 in October 2020. Why is it a game-changer for your Next.js website? Simple – images often pose a significant challenge to a website's performance, and the existing solutions are either costly, complex, or both. Now, let's dive into the wonders that [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image) brings to the table!

### Lazy Loading

By default, [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image) embraces lazy loading, meaning your images will only be loaded when they are about to enter the user's viewport. It's like magic – optimizing load times and user experience.

### Preloading

Even though lazy loading is the default, you can elevate the priority of certain images by using the `priority` prop. This ensures that crucial images are preloaded before the browser tackles other rendering tasks.

### Automatic Image Resizing

Say goodbye to the hassle of manual resizing! With [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image), images can automatically adjust to smaller sizes based on the user's screen. It's a seamless way to enhance performance without sacrificing quality.

### Format Transformation for Modern Browsers

This one's a game-changer! [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image) automatically transforms JPEG, PNG, or another format files into the more modern WebP format, potentially reducing image sizes by around 30% for users whose browsers support WebP.

## Implementation Unveiled!

Now, let's get our hands dirty and explore how we can seamlessly implement the Next.js Image Component. Brace yourself for an exhilarating journey into the realm of developer experience!

### Getting Started

Before the advent of [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image), we'd handle images like this:

```html
<img src="/image.jpg" width="160" height="160" alt="your image title" />
```

Now, with the magic of [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image), it's as easy as importing the component and transforming your HTML `<img>` element:

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image'

export default MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/image.jpg"
      width={160}
      height={160}
      alt="your image title"
    >
  )
}
```

### Pro Tips

If you prefer fixed-size images, the approach above works like a charm. But what if you're into responsive images? Fear not, here's a slick method for you:

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image'

export default MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div className="w-full aspect-square relative">
      <Image
        src="/image.jpg"
        fill
        sizes="100%"
        className="relative w-full h-full object-cover"
        alt="your image title"
      >
    </div>
  )
}
```

In this example, I've thrown in some [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for good measure. Take note that the parent element must have a relative position and a fixed aspect ratio. This ensures that the loaded image adheres to the parent's dimensions.

### Caution: Image Format Magic Ahead!

If you desire to load your images in modern formats like WebP, a bit of magic needs to happen in your `next.config.js`. Add the following snippet:

```js
module.exports = {
  images: {
    formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp']
  }
}
```

Incorporate this wisdom, and watch your images dazzle in the world of modern formats.

## The Behind-the-Scenes of next/image!

So, what's the magic happening behind the curtain when you unleash the [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image) Component? Let's peel back the layers and uncover the captivating process!

In a nutshell, the Next.js Image Component shoots a request back to the Next.js backend, armed with the values from the `src` prop and other essential tidbits. The backend then flexes its muscles with some image processing wizardry – we're talking format transformations, size tweaks, quality adjustments, and more.

This enchanting image processing dance is choreographed by none other than the [Sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) module. It's the behind-the-scenes maestro that orchestrates the visual symphony.

Once the backend has worked its magic, the transformed image is handed back to the client, ready to make its grand debut on the user's screen. And there you have it – the seamless, behind-the-scenes spectacle of the Next.js Image Component in action!

## The Power of Optimization!

Now, the moment of truth! After diving into the world of image optimization with [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image), let's unveil the dazzling results of this performance overhaul.

<div className='relative mx-auto aspect-[5/2] w-full md:w-[80%]'>
  <Image
    src='/img/blogs/exploring-next-image-in-next-js/screenshot-3.png'
    className='!mt-0'
    sizes='100%'
    alt='result'
    fill
  />
</div>

Surprisingly, my website's performance score skyrocketed to a solid 95 points! Just imagine the impact – from a decent 82 to a stellar 95. These numbers speak volumes about the significance of how we handle image loading on our websites. Witnessing this leap in performance, it's crystal clear – the way we load images plays a pivotal role in shaping the user experience.
